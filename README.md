# Gradle Buildlogic

This repository contains several useful Gradle build plugins that I've migrated
from ad-hoc adds to build and settings files into actual plugins. I hope that
you find them useful for your use as well. All are automatically deployed to
Github Packages upon commits and releases.

As I start releasing more plugins, I'll slowly start to migrate this project's
build to use them instead of the ad-hoc adds to the build files.
